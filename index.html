  <h2>
    Hey! <a href="/rss.xml"><img class="rss" src="images/rss.png" /></a>
  </h2>
  <p>Greetings!
This is the site of my fine self, thecoshman.
It is a personal site, where I can share my opinion with those who care to hear it.
Over time I'll write series of articles about various things I wish to write about.
By profession, I am Java developer, by enjoyment, I have nothing to do with Java.
I do various things for fun, but I'll refrain from yabbering on about benign details of my life.</p>

  <p>thecoshman is me, I am thecoshman (and yes, it is all lower case all the time).
I use this alias all over the shop, <a href="https://twitter.com/thecoshman">twitter</a> being a fine example.
That's probably the best way to contact me if you feel such a compulsion.</p>

  <p>For those who care about such details, I have this site hosted via <a href="http://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>.
It uses a swanky system called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, it takes <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and converts it into a static HTML site they host.
I might make a more detailed post about this at some stage, though there really isn't much to it.<p>

    {% for post in site.categories.other %}
      <li>
        <span class="date meta">{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> : 
        <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

<section id="tag">
  <h2>
    Technically A Game <!--<a href="/rss-rest.xml"><img class="rss" src="images/rss.png" /></a>-->
  </h2>
  <p>A series of posts charting my stumblings back into the word of games programing.</p>
  <ul>
    {% for post in site.categories.tag %}
      <li>
        <span class="date meta">{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> :: 
        <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="rest">
  <h2>
    REST <a href="/rss-rest.xml"><img class="rss" src="images/rss.png" /></a>
  </h2>
  <p>That simple word has cost me too much of my time trying to work out exactly what it means. 
I want to share my ramblings in a series of articles, hopefully it will prove useful to others. 
At some stage soon I might sort out a comment system, as I would love to get feedback from others, for now though, twitter or email maybe?</p>
