## A thousandth of a Picture

From a players point of view, all this update brings is a obnoxious text on screen. 
There is not much else either to be honest, CI and testing being the only other things of note. 
I shall cover these more boring topics first. 

I have set up Travis CI for automated builds, you can take a peak [here](https://travis-ci.org/thecoshman/tag) if you like.
Travis was fairly simple to set up, the `.travis.yaml` file was mostly standard stuff. 
Unit testing has also started, this is being done with Catch. 
I need to look to ramp up what I am testing, but the fact I am using OpenGL and thus require a context could make this awkward; that said, I don't see why I can't have a window openeded up for the purpose of running the tests.

For the next update I am going to focus on the HUD, primarily getting text rendered to the screen. This will allow me to free myself from the console, as I believe that presently, you can't actually start the game without doing so from the console. As I said, I would mostly like to focus on getting text drawn, then I can start to put information on screen such as the sacred FPS value, but also things such as how many chunks (of each type) are loaded, where the player is and so on.

Some other things that I want to start looking into in general is logging, testing and build automation. Logging is low down on that list to be fair, it will be useful later on for sure, when I get to it I'll have a proper look around, but I'm thinking log4cplus. Testing is mostly functional testing, for which I will probably use Catch, but I might also look at using Nonius to put put some timing tests. Accurate timing will be very useful later on when I am trying to improve the performance in trouble areas, though of course just some good old fashioned thinking about stuff can help a lot there too. In fact, logging will be helpful there too... but yeah, for now logging and timing is not really required. Build automation is one of those things that just needs to be done, especially if I want to get build for other platforms. I'm going to have to look into this a bit more, but I currently thinking Travis. Out of all of this, I may find that my current premake build scripts become tiresome to work with, so that might change too.

So all told, version five will rather dull from a player point of view, but these technical back end things have to be done at some point.
