## A quick recap

In the last article, I gave a (perhaps too verbose) description of the methods that HTTP 1.0 offered, in this article, I will carry on with that and describe those methods added in HTTP 1.1, but fear not, most of them are not worth much time. To get the boring details out of the way first.

### OPTIONS 

Basically, just let's a client ask what 'methods' would make sense for a URI. I find it hard to see why you use this. Sounds like if you do, your serice is not that well designed or badly documeneted.

### TRACE

More or less a 'ping' like method. I'm sure if you are trying to debug some issues it could be handy, but for the now I'm just going to leave it be.

### CONNECT 

Ok, now this is something that you shouldn't have to think twice about. It's used to help upgrade from HTTP to HTTPS. I'm not an expert on the old sequrity stuff, but as I understand it, most framewrosk will manage this for you.

### DELETE

I really wish I could have been there when they realised that HTTP 1.0 didn't allow resources to be deleted. I'm sure they had there reasoning, but still, it's there now. There aer a few intersting points with this method. Firstly, the server does not have to actually delete the resource, it's perfectl reasonable to simply make such that the URI can no longer reach that resource; you could move it to a 'admin only' area. Equally, you could simply return a 202 (Accepted) response; in which case the resource can still be reach, but at some stage it will be removed. This method is ofcourse, idempotent; if you ask to delete the same URI twice, you'll get the same response "sure thing, that's gone now".

### PUT

This is a method that many seem use wrong a fair bit.
